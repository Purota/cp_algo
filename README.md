# CP Algorithms

This repository contain various implementaion of well-known algorithms in Python (might do other languages later on). This serves as a training for me to develop my CP skills.

First of all, I will start by doing my own implementation of algorithms shared on this thread: https://discuss.codechef.com/t/data-structures-and-algorithms/6599.
