# CP Algorithms

This repository contain various implementaion of well-known algorithms in Python (might do other languages later on). This serves as a training for me to develop my CP skills.

First of all, I will start by doing my own implementation of algorithms shared on this thread: https://discuss.codechef.com/t/data-structures-and-algorithms/6599.

## Folder structure

The `algo` folder contains basic implementation of algorithms and solution to topic based problems.

The `contest` folder contains solutions to problems of competitions I participed in. Problems are organized into two sub-folders `solved` for problems that I managed to solve during the competition and `unsolved` for problems that I solved after the competition ended by myself or with the help of the editorial.
